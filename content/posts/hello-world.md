Welcome to my blog.

This is where I'll be sharing my journey building in public. Writing about AI, engineering, and the random things I'm learning along the way.

## Why a Blog?

In 2026, your online presence is your resume. Every post is proof of work - proof that you're thinking, learning, and creating.

I was inspired by some of my favorite tech bloggers:
- [Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/) - Deep technical posts on AI/ML
- [Eugene Yan](https://eugeneyan.com/) - ML systems and career
- [Hamel Husain](https://hamel.dev/) - Practical ML engineering
- [Huyen Chip](https://huyenchip.com/) - ML systems design
- [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/) - Educational ML content

## The Real Motivation

Some advice I read recently hit hard:

1. Use AI tools intentionally - work *with* them, not just let them work *for* you
2. Build side projects that could actually make money
3. Ship. No excuses. Get users, listen to feedback, iterate
4. Write publicly about what you're learning

The era of JIRA jockeys making $400k pushing tickets is over. If you want to stand out, you need to build things, ship them, and tell people about it.

That's exactly what I'm doing here.

## What to Expect

- Technical tutorials and explanations
- Lessons learned from building things
- Occasional personal reflections

Let's see where this goes.
